Rekognition-ECR Demo
In this demo you will be creating a Rekognition model that will be used to detect cats and dogs images. You will then build a simple Flask application using Docker that will be used to test the Rekognition model. This application will be uploaded to an ECR repository and deployed to an ECS cluster.

The demo is dividen in 5 stages:

Stage 1 - Create and train the Rekognition model
Stage 2 - Create the ECR repository and build the Docker image
Stage 3 - Create the ECS cluster, ECS task definition and ECS service
Stage 4 - Test the application
Stage 5 - Clean up
1-Click Install
Make sure you are logged into AWS and in us-east-1 Apply the template below and wait for CREATE_COMPLETE before continuing
ekognition-ECR Demo
In this part of the DEMO, you will be doing the following:-

Creating a Rekognition model that will be used to detect cats and dogs in images.
Training the model with a set of images that contain cats and dogs.
STAGE 1 - Create and train the Rekognition model
Navigate to the Rekognition console: https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/rekognition/home?region=us-east-1#/

In the left-hand menu, click on "Use Custom Labels".

Click on the "Get started" button.

A pop-up window will appear if you have not created a Rekognition Custom Labels project before. This pop-up windows will ask you to create an S3 bucket to store all the data related to the model that you will be training. Save the name of the bucket that will be created, it will have the following format: custom-labels-console-us-east-1-<random string>. You will need it in the cleanup stage. Click on the "Create S3 bucket" button to create the S3 bucket.

In the left-hand menu, click on "Projects" and create a project with the name "skynet-cats-and-dogs". Click on the "Create dataset" button and select the following options:

Configuration options: Start with a single dataset
Training dataset details: Upload images from your computer
Click Create Dataset
In the following screen, you will be able to upload the images that will be used to train the model. These images are contained in the following files:-

Cats-part1
Cats-part2
Cats-part3
Cats-part4
Cats-part5
Cats-part6
Dogs-part1
Dogs-part2
Dogs-part3
Dogs-part4
Dogs-part5
Dogs-part6
Unzip the files. You should see a total of 12 foldeds.
Currently, the AWS console allows you to upload 30 images at a time, so you will need to do it in multiple attempts.

Click on the top-right "Actions" button and then click on "Add images to training dataset" to start uploading the images.
Click Choose files
Go inside the folder for the first part of the cat images
Select all the images
Click open
Then Click Upload Images
Wait until you see You successfully saved the changes to your training dataset.. Then repeat the process for the remaining 5 folders of Cat images (we will be doing the dog images in a separate step)

Once you have uploaded all 6 of the cat image folders, click Start Labeling then click Add Labels, and select Add Labels.
Add a label cat click Add label and add another dog, click Add label then click Save

Select Unlabeled on the Labels list on the left, and go through each page of images :

select all the images
Click Assign Image-Level Labels
Type cat and select the cat label and click Assign
Move to the next page and Continue the above process for all pages of cat images.
Once you've finished you can click Save Changes
Once saved, you should have 0 unlabeled images.

Now it's time to repeat the process for the dog images within the dataset.

Click on the top-right "Actions" button and then click on "Add images to training dataset" to start uploading the images.
Click Choose files
Go inside the folder for the first part of the dog images
Select all the images
Click open
Then Click Upload Images
Wait until you see You successfully saved the changes to your training dataset.. Then repeat the process for the remaining 5 folders of Dog images

Once finished, select Unlabeled from the labels menu on the bottom left. You should see all the dog images.
Click Start Labelling and go through each page of images

select all the images
Click Assign Image-Level Labels
Type dog and select the dog label and click Assign
Once you have done all pages, scroll to the top and click Save Changes.
Make sure you see 0 unlabelled images.

Click on the top-right "Train model" button. In the next screen, click on the "Train model" button and then click again on the "Train model" button that appears in the pop-up window.

To check the progress of the training, take a look at the "Model status" column. It will change the status to TRAINING_COMPLETED once the training is complete. The training process can take approximately 40-60 minutes to complete, so you can start the stages 2 and 3A while the model is being trained.
